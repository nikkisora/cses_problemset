You are given an n \times n grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or has a tree. Your task is to process q queries of the following types:
Change the state (empty/tree) of a square.
How many trees are inside a rectangle in the forest?

Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are n lines describing the forest. Each line has n characters: . is an empty square and * is a tree.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "1 y x" or "2 y_1 x_1 y_2 x_2".

Output

Print the answer to each query of the second type.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= y,x <= n
1 <= y_1 <= y_2 <= n
1 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= n
