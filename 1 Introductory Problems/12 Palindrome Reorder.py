CSES - Palindrome Reorder



Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB

Given a string, your task is to reorder its letters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).

Input


The only input line has a string of length n consisting of characters Aï¿½Z.

Output


Print a palindrome consisting of the characters of the original string. You may print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^6

Example


Input:
AAAACACBA


Output:
AACABACAA
