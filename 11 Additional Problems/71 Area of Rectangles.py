Given n rectangles, your task is to determine the total area of their union.

Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of rectangles.

After that, there are n lines describing the rectangles. Each line has four integers x_1, y_1, x_2 and y_2: a rectangle begins at point (x_1,y_1) and ends at point (x_2,y_2).

Output

Print the total area covered by the rectangles.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5
-10^6 <= x_1 < x_2 <= 10^6
-10^6 <= y_1 < y_2 <= 10^6
