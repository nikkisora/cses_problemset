You have n coins with positive integer values. The coins are numbered 1,2,...,n.

Your task is to process q queries of the form: "if you can use coins a ... b, what is the smallest sum you cannot produce?"

Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of coins and queries.

The second line has n integers x_1,x_2,...,x_n: the value of each coin.

Finally, there are q lines that describe the queries. Each line has two values a and b: you can use coins a ... b.

Output

Print the answer for each query.

Constraints

1 <= n, q <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= x_i <= 10^9
1 <= a <= b <= n

Example

Input:
5 3
2 9 1 2 7
2 4
4 4
1 5

Output:
4
1
