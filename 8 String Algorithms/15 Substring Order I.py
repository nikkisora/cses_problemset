Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB

You are given a string of length n. If all of its distinct substrings are ordered lexicographically, what is the kth smallest of them?

Input

The first input line has a string of length n that consists of characters a�z.

The second input line has an integer k.

Output

Print the kth smallest distinct substring in lexicographical order.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= k <= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
It is guaranteed that k does not exceed the number of distinct substrings.

Example

Input:
babaacbaab
10

Output:
aba

Explanation: The 10 smallest distinct substrings in order are a, aa, aab, aac, aacb, aacba, aacbaa, aacbaab, ab, and aba.
