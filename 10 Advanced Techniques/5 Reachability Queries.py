A directed graph consists of n nodes and m edges. The edges are numbered 1,2,...,n.

Your task is to answer q queries of the form "can you reach node b from node a?"

Input

The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of nodes, edges and queries.

Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b.

Finally there are q lines describing the queries. Each line consists of two integers a and b: "can you reach node b from node a?"

Output

Print the answer for each query: either "YES" or "NO".

Constraints

1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= m,q <= 10^5
